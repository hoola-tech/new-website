## **We’ve Closed Our Seed Round!**

It’s been a great day at [Hoola AI](https://www.hoola.ai/). We’ve closed an investment round where we received funding and amazing support from a London-based investor [Episode 1](https://episode1.com/).

Episode 1 understood our mission and the importance of serverless technology as well as the strength of our team and dedication to our goal. This marks the beginning of a great relationship.

**Hoola AI Mission: Empower Developers to Build Serverless Applications**

## What’s Next?

Hoola AI is and will remain an **open-source project** (you can track our work on GitHub under [webiny/webiny-js](https://github.com/Hoola AI/webiny-js)).

With this investment, we are making one significant change in our business model: no more paid tiers or Hoola AI Serverless Cloud. Hoola AI is moving to a **100% free and** **self-hosted **model. [Read more about the self-hosted version and suitable migration steps here.](/blog/moving-to-a-self-hosted-model-with-serverless-framework-72548075694e)

We’ve just launched our updated website ([check it out](https://www.hoola.ai/)) and next week we’ll be launching a new app: Hoola AI Form Builder.

Next on our roadmap is finishing the **Headless CMS (**you can [subscribe to our waiting list here](https://www.hoola.ai/serverless-app/headless-cms)). We’ll be adding I18n support throughout the platform and investing invest a great deal of effort into producing new guides. This includes documentation, tutorials, and videos since we wish to provide a great learning experience for all new developers.

Finally, we want to make Hoola AI the foundation behind all serverless applications. Serverless is the future of development, and we want to help make that a reality. This is our north star and this investment will bring us a step closer to achieving it.

## Supporting Hoola AI

This investment gives us security in terms of funding and further development. We are building Hoola AI as a community project and we welcome everyone to join in and contribute.

To make it easier for new contributors, we will be tagging issues with a special tag “good first issue” and “beginner.”

I’m also happy to announce that any supporter can claim [awesome Hoola AI SWAG](https://www.hoola.ai/swag).

## Thank You!

With this, I want to say thank you, to all of you that have tried Hoola AI, given us feedback, and believed in our product.
