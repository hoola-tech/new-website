ESLint is a great tool when it comes to code standardization. Maintained by the open source community, and with a rich plugin-based eco system, you basically already have everything you need to produce a solid codebase.

But in some cases, you might want to enforce one or more ESLint code rules that are specific to your particular project. Okay, first you take a look at NPM and check if there is an existing plugin. But after searching a bit, you didnâ€™t find anything that would suit your specific needs and for that reason, you decided to create your own custom ESLint plugin.

If thatâ€™s your case, then follow along because here we will show how to accomplish this in 5 simple steps.

Before we continue, just wanted to mention this is not a tutorial on how to write ESLint rules / plugins. Itâ€™s just a quick guide on how to get per-project rules up and running quickly.

So here we go!

## 5 steps

1. Inside your project folder, create a folder. I will name mine `eslint`, but exact location / name is not important at this point.

2. Inside the folder, we create a`package.json` file with following content:

```
// eslint/package.json
{
  "name": "eslint-plugin-my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

Please note that that the package name must start with `eslint-plugin-` prefix, as it is an ESLint requirement.

3. Then we also create an`index.js` file, which will contain all of the plugin rules. If you donâ€™t know how to write ESLint rules, take a look at [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) example, itâ€™s not too complicated (at least for simple cases).

The following example was copied from the AST explorer website, and it just prevents developers from using [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Not very useful maybe, but for demonstration purposes of this guide, it will suffice.

```
// eslint/index.js
module.exports = {
    rules: {
        "no-template-literals": {
            create: function(context) {
                return {
                    TemplateLiteral(node) {
                        context.report(node, 'Do not use template literals');
                    }
                };
            }
        }
    }
};
```

4. Once youâ€™re done, in your project root, add the plugin as a dependency using `yarn`(or `npm`):

```
yarn add --dev file:./eslint
```

Notice the `file:./eslint` part. [This syntax](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/add/) will allow us to install a package that is on our local file system.

After executing, inside the `node_modules` folder, you should have the `eslint-plugin-my-project` folder that contains both `index.js` and `package.json` files.

5. Finally, add the plugin and rule in your `eslintrc` file. You can do that like so:

```
// eslintrc.js
module.exports = {

    (...)
    plugins: ["my-project"],
    rules: {
        "flowtype/define-flow-type": 1,
        "my-project/no-template-literals": 1
    }
    (...)
};
```

## Weâ€™re done!

That wasnâ€™t too bad, right? ðŸ˜Š

Try adding a simple template literal in your code. If youâ€™ve done everything correctly, you should get an ESLint warning. Now continue with the files weâ€™ve just created and start defining your own custom rules!
