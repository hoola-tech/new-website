## 🆕 What’s New In Hoola AI 4.10.0?

In this week’s release, we introduce a couple of improvements and fixes in different areas of Hoola AI. Let’s check them out!

## 🚀 Features

**Added refresh content button ([a38b458](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/a38b4586a2c1094afc0c024e8365ae33a1edc7ee))**

A small but useful addition can be found in the content editing form. We added the refresh content button, which, as the name itself suggests, refreshes the content entry you’re currently looking at. This can be useful if for some reason the data isn’t up-to-date (for example, another user made updates on it in the meantime), and you want to get the latest data as quickly as possible, without refreshing the whole page.

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

**Ref fields are always referencing the correct revision ([#1204](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1204)**

Until now, every time a content entry would reference another content entry via the Reference field, it would always point to a specific content entry revision, even if new revisions of the referenced content entry were created. From now on, the reference field will, respectively, always point to the latest and published revisions, on READ (e.g. [myApi.net/cms/read/production](http://myapi.net/cms/read/production)) and MANAGE (e.g. [myApi.net/cms/manage/production](http://myapi.net/cms/manage/production)) APIs.

#### Migration:

Note that this new functionality will not work on previously saved content, meaning, ref fields on existing content entries will still behave like always — point to a specific content entry revision (instead of the latest / published, like described above). In order to “fix” those, you will need to open the entries that contain a value in the ref field save them. This will cause the links in the background to be updated, and from that point on, everything will work as expected for that particular entry. If you have a lot of data that needs to be updated, let us know, we might help you with creating a simple database script (it’s fairly simple).
