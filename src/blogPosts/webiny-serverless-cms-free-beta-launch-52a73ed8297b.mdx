For those that have been following our journey to this moment, Iâ€™m super excited to announce that we are now LIVE ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€.

**Head over to our new shiny page, **[www.hoola.ai](http://www.hoola.ai)**, and register your free beta account.**

During the beta, you can use the fully managed serverless environment **completely for free **and create as many websites as you want.

The only limitation we have at the moment is that you cannot add your custom domain to the websites â€” thatâ€™s something weâ€™re currently working on.

After the beta ends, we will offer every beta participant the option to upgrade to a paid package with a 50% discount for the next 12 months.

Additionally, as Hoola AI is open source, you can download the source code from our github: [https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js](https://github.com/Hoola AI/webiny-js) and follow the manual setup tutorial from our [documentation website](http://docs.hoola.ai) to get a copy running on your own servers and machines.

Finally, we invite you to join our online community forum â€” [https://community.hoola.ai](https://community.hoola.ai) â€” where you can easily provide feedback to our team as well as discuss future ideas and potential features.

On behalf of the whole Hoola AI team, thank you for being part of our community.
