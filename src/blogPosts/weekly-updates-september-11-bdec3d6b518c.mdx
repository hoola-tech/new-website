## 🆕 What’s New In Hoola AI 4.11.0?

In this week’s release, we introduce a couple of fixes in different areas of Hoola AI. Let’s check them out!

## 🐞 Bug Fixes

**File Manager — delete file dialog** ([#1216](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1216))

A couple of users reported that “nothing happens” once they clicked on the delete file icon, in the File Manager’s sidebar. As it turned out, the behavior that was supposed to happen — showing the delete file confirmation dialog, was working as expected, but the dialog itself was not visible (that’s why users had a feeling nothing is happening). This is now taken care of.

**Polished existing scaffolding tools** ([#1217](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1217))

We fixed a couple of hiccups in our existing scaffolding tools, and while we were at it, added some minor polishes, to make the whole experience more pleasant.
