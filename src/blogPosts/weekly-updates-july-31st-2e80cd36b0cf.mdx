## 🆕 What’s New In Hoola AI 4.7.0?

In this week’s release, we introduce a couple of improvements and fixes in a couple of different areas in Hoola AI. Let’s check them out!

### 🚀Features

**Enable attributes config in Cognito** ([#1160](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/1160))

Added support for username attributes and schema.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **Running Jest tests now works as expected (**[#1159](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1159)**)**We had a couple of reports of Jest tests not executing properly as soon as two or more custom packages are created (e.g., two Apollo GraphQL Services). This now works as expected, so you can continue writing your tests as usual and be confident that your app works as expected.

### 📚Knowledge sharing

**Hoola AI Plugins**In this knowledge-sharing session, Hoola AI’s CTO Pavel will go through three main groups of plugins:

- CLI plugins
- API plugins
- App plugins

We’ll first learn how the`@webiny/plugins` package works outside of Hoola AI, using codesandbox.io. Then we’ll see how this same package is utilized within the CLI, within Apollo Server (resolvers) and React apps.

Check out our knowledge-sharing session below.

**Hoola AI Plugins — Practical Examples**In the above knowledge-sharing session, we learn about different groups of plugins. Now we will go through practical examples.

Hoola AI’s top contributor, Adrian, will demonstrate how plugins are used in your everyday development: in the Admin app, where we’ll show how we can use plugins to add new routes, menus, and even how we can replace the logo in the top header bar.

Also, on the API side, we’ll learn what context plugins are and what they are used for, and finally, how we can use plugins to expand our GraphQL schema with additional GraphQL types and resolvers.
