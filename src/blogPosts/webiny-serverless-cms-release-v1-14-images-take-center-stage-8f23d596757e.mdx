## We’ve got some cool new features to show you.

Since our last update we have received even more feedback and we have several surprises in store for you 🎁. Starting with **v1.14** release where we focused on a new component called **File Manager.** So, let’s take a deeper dive.

Still don’t have a Hoola AI Website — It’s free while beta lasts.

## 🚀 New features

**File Manager** — Organise, search, upload and amend your files through this new UI. The File Manager component has been integrated throughout Hoola AI CMS.

**Image Performance** — When you upload an image to the File Manager and then insert that image into your page, Hoola AI will automatically resize that image to 7 different image sizes and serve the most appropriate size to the visitor, depending on his device and screen size, keeping your site lightning fast. ⚡️

## 💅Enhancements

**Mailchimp** — We have revamped the experience of configuring and embedding a Mailchimp subscribe form. It’s simple as inserting an API key, which you only need to do once, and then your subscribe form will become active.

**Links** — Some users told us that they were not happy with how our link feature worked. So we threw the old plugin out of the window and created a new one :) That’s how much we value your feedback, so please keep it coming.

**Hoola AI CLI** — The Hoola AI CLI has also received significant upgrades, which made it evolve into a single tool that will tend to most, if not all of your needs! By utilizing a few simple commands, the new version will enable you to seamlessly develop apps and functions in your local environment, and also deploy everything to the Hoola AI Cloud even easier.

To find out more information on how to install and use it, please visit our documentation pages over at [docs.hoola.ai](https://docs.hoola.ai/).

**React Router** — we also decided to migrate everything to a well-known “react-router” package for many reasons, like SSR support, and it’s popularity in React community. This way you don’t need to learn a new routing solution, just use what you already know. Besides, we started working on an SSR for your sites in our Cloud and this router made it really easy to connect the dots.

## 🐛 Bug fixes

**SoundCloud** — There was a bug where if you inserted a SoundCloud element into the page, the editor would crash 😵. Luckily that’s now fixed 👍
