                            <br />
                            We are concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from
                            inappropriate disclosure. We implement a variety of security measures to
                            ensure the security of your Personal Data on our systems, including
                            adopting a secure protocol and encrypting our databases. Any Personal
                            Data collected by us is only accessible by a limited number of employees
                            who have special access rights to such systems and are bound by
                            obligations of confidentiality. If and when we use subcontractors to
                            store your data, we will not relinquish control of your Personal Data or
                            expose it to security risks that would not have arisen had the data
                            remained in our possession. However, unfortunately no transmission of
                            data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be
                            possible for third parties not under the control of Hoola Technology
                            Limited to intercept or access transmissions or private communications
                            unlawfully. While we strive to protect your Personal Data, we cannot
                            ensure or warrant the security of any Personal Data you transmit to us.
                            Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your
                            interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us.

                            You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by
                            clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails.

                            <br />
                            We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm

                            (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
                            ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no
                            right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further

                            All uses of the word “including” mean “including but not limited to” and
                            the enumerated examples are not intended to in any way limit the term
                            which they serve to illustrate. Any email addresses set out in this
                            policy may be used solely for the purpose for which they are stated to
                            be provided, and any unrelated correspondence will be ignored. Unless
                            otherwise required by law, we reserve the right to not respond to
                            emails, even if they relate to a legitimate subject matter for which we
                            have provided an email address. You are more likely to get a reply if
                            your request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no
                            relatively obvious other way to deal with or answer your concern or
                            question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website, etc.).
                            <br />
                            Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of Hoola Technology

                            otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a Hoola Technology
                            Limited address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any
                            official public announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or
                            amounts to a waiver of any Hoola Technology Limited rights, the email
                            content will be read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only
