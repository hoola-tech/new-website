                    Our CLI allows you to shape your workflow by writing simple plugins. Even the

                    your own, expanding your toolkit has never been easier.

                    request on a specified URL.

                    Hoola AI sites runs inside a serverless environment. That offers unlimited
                    scalability so no matter the load. Your users will experience great performance.
                    Serverless also eliminates the need to over provision and overpay for
                    infrastructure.
