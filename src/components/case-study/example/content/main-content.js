                    ActiveCampaign is so flexible. I was able to create a loyalty program that has
                    helped us learn more about our customers and keep them engaged. We are now
                    understanding our customers better and becoming more personal at every
                    touchpoint.

                    When <a href="https://hoola.ai">Koia's</a> founders saw firsthand the toll
                    that stress and poor nutrition can have on people, they decided to create a
                    product that helped people live healthier lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do so, they studied regions in the world where people live longer than others
                    - and eat predominantly plant-based diets, make movement part of every day, and
                    stay socially active.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Koia's name is inspired by one of those studied places, the lush Nicoya
                    Peninsula in Costa Rica. Plant-powered Koia brings these values to life with
                    protein, keto, and coffee plan-based drinks and shakes, designed to provide
                    people a balance of complete protein, fiber, and healthy fats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To bring their product to a broader audience and build the Koia community, the
                    Koia team turned to Customer Experience Automation(CXA).

                    When they started email marketing, the Koia team used Mailchimp, which was great
                    way to get their feet we with email campaigns. But as Koia experienced
                    tremendous growth, they wanted a platform that could grow with them.
