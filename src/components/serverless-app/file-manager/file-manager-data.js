                    Images are often the types of files that need that extra touch. With File
                    Manager, you can manipulate an image and apply different filter to it right
                    there from within the UI. It will create a copy of the original image, so you
                    never lose the source file.

                    There is an always-visible search bar at the top of the screen. Any word you
                    type in, the system will try to match against the file name, any of the tags or
                    the file label. This makes it easy to find the file you're looking for.

                    Tags are visible on the left side of the screen. They act similar to a folder.
                    Clicking a tag, will only show images that have that tag applied. You can always
                    create new tags by simply tagging an image.

                    In some cases, when you have a big number of images, they can slow down the load
                    time it takes to display all that content on your screen. Often systems
                    introduce pagination to avoid that, but that's clumsy to use.

                    Hoola AI File Manager uses an infinitive scroll and lazy loading mechanism. This
                    way the content is displayed right away, and there is no need to click through
                    pages.
