                    Environments are a powerful feature in Hoola AI Headless CMS. Creating a new

                    Aliases go in hand with environments. Each environment is linked to an alias,

                    An alias can be unlinked from one environment and linked to another environment.
                    This allows instant switching between different version of your content, as well
                    as instant rollbacks.
