                    There are cases where you want to trigger specific actions each time someone
                    submits a form. In some examples you might even want to notify and send the data
                    to a 3rd party. Examples are zapier, slack and similar. Hoola AI Form Builder
                    allows this integration via a webhook. All you need is the POST URL of the 3rd
                    party.

                    Once happy with how the form looks like, it's time to insert it into a page. The
                    provided integration with Hoola AI Page Builder makes this super easy. It's a
                    simple matter of dragging and dropping the form element into a column on a page.
                    Once inserted you will select which form and which revision should to display.
